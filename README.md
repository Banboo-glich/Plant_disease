# Plant_disease
plant health checkup system

The flow goes like this
(1) Using RaspberryPi, acquire images of plants.
2) The information is passed to the API (Artificial Intelligence Model). Then, we ask the API to return what kind of disease it has and how to counter it.
(3) Notification is sent to LINE using the LINE API. We created this system in the hope that farmers will be able to grasp the health status of their crops without having to go all the way to the field.
